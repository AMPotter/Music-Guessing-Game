Music-Guessing-Game
===================
This game is a simple little game in which you guess my personal favorite genre of music. Usually the septum ring gives it away, but maybe the player doesn't know what I look like? It's an extremely simple script, because I'm still figuring out Git and didn't want to spend more time on the script than on learning Git, which I really need to get going on!
